# Metis – A JLP-Based Yield Aggregator on Solana

**Metis** is an on-chain yield aggregator built on **Solana**, designed to optimize returns for users holding **JLP (Jupiter Liquidity Provider)** tokens. With Metis, users can seamlessly deposit JLP, select their risk tolerance, and have their assets allocated across top-performing protocols — all without lifting a finger.

## ⚡ What is Metis?

Managing yield strategies manually is time-consuming, risky, and inefficient. **Metis automates this process** by:
- Accepting deposits in JLP
- Allocating funds across DeFi protocols based on yield vs. risk scoring
- Continuously calculating and accruing rewards
- Supporting easy withdrawals and reward claiming

Whether you're a passive holder or an active DeFi user — Metis helps your JLP work smarter.

## Built With

- **Solana** – Ultra-fast L1 blockchain

- **JLP Token** – Jupiter’s Liquidity Provider token
- Custom logic for risk-aware, APY-optimized protocol allocation

## Key Features

- **Deposit JLP tokens** and automatically earn yield
- Smart allocation engine based on **risk score and APY**
